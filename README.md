This is a kind of composer reusable package
    - run composer install
    - create .env file and override keys values
    - set your own public key in payment.html.twig for Stripe('pk_...........')
    - open your mysql shell and use dump.sql commands to create database and tables connected with this package
    - run server with "php -S localhost:8000 index.php" so that index.php file can provide an app showing basic functionality of this package
